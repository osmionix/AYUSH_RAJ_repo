# TicTacToe_java
This Java program implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. 

# **Rules**
Players take turns selecting grid positions, with 'X' and 'O' markers. 
The game checks for a winner after each move and announces the result. 
If all positions are filled without a winner, it declares a tie.
